Resistor Calculator will promt user for colors of three bands on a resistor and output the resistance value in ohms.
    Code Utilizes
      fgets()
      strcmp()
      strlen()
      Arrays

RMS Calculator will promt user for amplitude of sin wave and output the RMS(Root Mean Square) value in volts
    Code Utilizes
        Populating an array
        Pointers
        math.h 

Signal Composition adds several odd-multiple sin wave harmonics at decreasing amplitudes and prints the results in a new file. The values can then be graphed, the resulting graph will show that the sum of all sin waves will yield a square wave.
    Code Utilizes
        fopen()
        fprint()
        fclose()
